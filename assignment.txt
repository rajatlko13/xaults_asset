Coding Challenge: Upgradeable Asset Tokenizer
Estimated Time: 1-2 days
Focus: Smart Contract Ecosystem, UUPS Upgradeability, Storage Layout
Deadline: Sun, Jan 18, 2026
email: hiring@xaults.com

Objective
Design and implement a secure, UUPS-upgradeable smart contract representing a tokenized nancial asset.
You are required to plan the entire lifecycle: development, testing, and deployment scripts. You are
expected to use the latest industry-standard tools available. The design must follow basic smart-contract
security best practices and include clear event emission for minting and administrative actions.

The Scenario
Xaults is launching a new tokenized asset class. As this is a long-term nancial instrument, the contract logic
will need to evolve over time. You are tasked with building the V1 implementation and demonstrating a safe
upgrade path to V2 using scripts and tests.

Core Requirements
1. Smart Contract Architecture (V1)
Implement a contract named AssetToken that inherits from OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts.
Standard: ERC-20 (Upgradeable).
Pattern: UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard).
Initialization: Use an initialize() function (no constructors).
Storage Safety: Ensure future upgrades do not corrupt storage.

2. Logic & Access Control
Roles: Use DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE (for upgrades/admin) and MINTER_ROLE.
Minting: Restricted to MINTER_ROLE and capped at maxSupply. Revert with a custom error
MaxSupplyExceeded() if breached.

Transfer: Standard token transfers between users.
Upgrades: Ensure only the Admin can upgrade the contract logic.

3. Environment Tasks

You must demonstrate pro ciency with the toolchain:
Testing: Write a test suite in Solidity (not TypeScript/JavaScript).
Scripting: Write a Solidity-based deployment script that deploys the V1 implementation, initializes the
ERC1967Proxy, and sets up the admin.
CLI Interaction: Include a command-line snippet showing how you would manually interact with the
contract (e.g., minting a token) if it were deployed to a local testnet node.

The Test Suite
Your Solidity test le should validate the entire upgrade lifecycle:
1. Setup: Deploy V1 via an ERC1967Proxy. Initialize with 1M max supply.
2. State Check: Mint 100 tokens to a user. Assert balanceOf is 100.
3. Upgrade:
Deploy AssetTokenV2 (which adds a pause() function).
Execute the upgrade on the proxy to switch to V2.
4. Persistence Check: Assert the user's balance is still 100.
5. New Logic Check: Call pause() on V2 and assert that transfers now revert.

Deliverables
1. Source Code: src/AssetToken.sol and src/AssetTokenV2.sol.
2. Tests: A Solidity test le located in the test/ directory.
3. Scripts: A deployment script located in the script/ directory.
4. README:
Instructions to setup, deploy, run, and test the assignment.
A brief explanation of how you veri ed that the storage layout was safe for the upgrade.
